# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is the first game i've created. It is a simple tic tac toe game that uses a 2d array to represent the board. The code is modularized with functions having specific duties 
and input validation is done effectively.
The generatecomputerchoice() method is very simple so i might make it more complex later.
